# Real And Fake Job Posting Prediction

# Abstract

Employment scams are on the rise. According to CNBC, the number of employment scams doubled in 2018 as compared to 2017. The current market situation has led to high unemployment. Economic stress and the coronavirusâ€™s impact have significantly reduced job availability and job loss for many individuals. A case like this presents an appropriate opportunity for scammers. Many people are falling prey to these scammers using the desperation that is caused by an unprecedented incident. Most scammers do this to get personal information from the person they are scamming. Personal information can contain addresses, bank account details, social security numbers, etc. The scammers provide users with a very lucrative job opportunity and later ask for money in return. Or they require investment from the job seeker with the promise of a job. This is a dangerous problem that can be addressed through Machine Learning techniques and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

# Design

This project uses data provided from Kaggle. This data contains features that define a job posting. These job postings are categorized as either real or fake. Fake job postings are a very small fraction of this dataset. That is as excepted. We do not expect a lot of fake jobs postings. This project follows five stages. 

The five stages adopted for this project are:  
1.	Problem Definition (Project Overview, Project statement and Metrics) 
2.	Data Collection  
3.	Data cleaning, exploring and pre-processing 
4.	Modeling 
5.	Evaluation
